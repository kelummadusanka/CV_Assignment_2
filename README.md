Take Home Assignment 2

Write Python programs to perform the following image processing operations.

1. Consider an image with 2 objects and a total of 3-pixel values (1 for each object and one 
for the background). Add Gaussian noise to the image. Implement and test Otsu’s 
algorithm with this image.

2. Implement a region-growing technique for image segmentation. The basic idea is to start 
from a set of points inside the object of interest (foreground), denoted as seeds, and 
recursively add neighboring pixels as long as they are in a pre-defined range of the pixel 
values of the seeds.
